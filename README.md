# Introduction:

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), originally invented for computer vision, have been shown to achieve strong performance on text classification tasks (Bai et al., 2018; Kalchbrenner et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2015; Zhang et al., 2015; Johnson and Zhang, 2015; Iyyer et al., 2015) as well as other traditional Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks (Collobert et al., 2011), even when considering relatively simple one-layer models (Kim, 2014). As with other architectures of neural networks, explaining the learned functionality of CNNs is still an active research area. The ability to interpret neural models can be used to increase trust in model predictions, analyze errors or improve the model (Ribeiro et al., 2016). In this assignment we’re supposed to classify the imdb movie reviews dataset as a positive or negative reviews. The work will be divided into 3 parts:

Data preprocessing: which is mainly about getting the data ready to be processed my our model
Defining the model : implementing the “vanilla” model
Optimization of the architecture: performing Grid-Search of several meta-parameters and hyper-parameters
